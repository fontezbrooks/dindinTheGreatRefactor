      "description": "Recipe video above. The smell when this is cooking is outrageous! The marinade is very quick to prepare and the chicken can be frozen in the marinade, then defrosted prior to cooking. Best cooked on the outdoor grill / BBQ, but I usually make it on the stove. Serve with Yogurt Sauce (provided) or the Tahini sauce in this recipe. Add a simple salad and flatbread laid out on a large platter, then let everyone make their own wraps!",

The light colored helps you determine when the butter begins browning. Melt the butter over medium heat and stir or whisk constantly. Once melted, the butter will begin to foam. Keep stirring/whisking. After 5-7 minutes, the butter will begin browning and you&#8217;ll notice lightly browned specks begin to form at the bottom of the pan, which are the milk solids toasting. Cook until it is golden in color. Once browned, remove from heat immediately and pour into dish. Cover tightly, place in the refrigerator, and chill until solid, about 2-3 hours (or up to 1 day). A large flat dish, as opposed to a bowl, helps the butter solidify quicker."
