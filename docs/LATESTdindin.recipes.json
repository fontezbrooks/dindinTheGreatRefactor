Add the paprika, coriander, cumin, and harissa paste, and stir and cook for another minute. Add the tomatoes and remaining ½ teaspoon of salt, and stir to combine.

  "description": "Birthdays: A time for singing, balloons, and (of course) cake. Some of us have a dedicated favorite, but perhaps no cake is more universally topped with candles than the classic yellow cake with chocolate frosting. Despite its ubiquity in bakeries nationwide (and in mix form on grocery store shelves), great homemade versions of this chocolate-on-vanilla duo are somewhat elusive. But after months of testing, we think we've nailed it. Join us in celebrating this classic American cake and the birthdays it commemorates; crowned our 2019 Recipe of the Year.",

Roll into a ball, then use your fingers to shape the cookie dough so that it’s taller rather than wide—almost like a cylinder. This helps the cookies bake up thicker. Repeat with remaining dough.

Always bake lemon bars at a lower temperature to avoid over-baking. See recipe notes for important tips. They're simply the best lemon bars and are perfect for picnics, bake sales, spring brunches, baby showers, and bridal showers.",

The light colored helps you determine when the butter begins browning. Melt the butter over medium heat and stir or whisk constantly. Once melted, the butter will begin to foam. Keep stirring/whisking. After 5-7 minutes, the butter will begin browning and you’ll notice lightly browned specks begin to form at the bottom of the pan, which are the milk solids toasting. Cook until it is golden in color. Once browned, remove from heat immediately and pour into dish. Cover tightly, place in the refrigerator, and chill until solid, about 2-3 hours (or up to 1 day). A large flat dish, as opposed to a bowl, helps the butter solidify quicker."

Using sharp kitchen shears, remove backbone by cutting along either side of it. Turn chicken over and lay out flat. Press firmly on breast to flatten chicken. For added stability, run a metal or wooden skewer horizontally through chicken, entering through one thigh, going through both breast halves, and exiting through other thigh. Tuck wing tips behind back."

Carefully flip chicken and place, skin side down, on hotter side of grill, with breasts pointed toward cooler side. Press down firmly with a wide, stiff spatula to ensure good contact between bird and grill grates. Cover and cook until skin is crisp and an instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part of breast registers 145 to 150°F (63 to 66°C), about 10 minutes longer. If chicken threatens to burn before temperature is achieved, carefully slide to cooler side of grill, cover, and continue to cook until done. Do not leave the lid off for longer than it takes to check temperature, or chicken will burn."
